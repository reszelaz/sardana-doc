Pseudo motor overview
=======================

The pseudo motor interface acts like an abstraction layer for a motor
or a set of motors allowing the user to control the experiment by
means of an interface which is more meaningful to him(her).

One of the most basic examples is the control of a slit. The slit has two blades
with one motor each. Usually the user doesn't want to control the experiment by
directly handling these two motor positions since they have little meaning from
the experiments perspective. Instead, it would be more useful for the user to
control the experiment by means of changing the gap and offset values. In the
:class:`~sardana.pool.poolcontrollers.Slit` controller, pseudo motors gap and
offset will provide the necessary interface for controlling the experiments
gap and offset values respectively.

    An animation [#]_ representing a system of slits composed from horizontal
    blades (left and right) an vertical blades (top and bottom).

In order to translate the motor positions into the pseudo motor positions and
vice versa, calculations have to be performed. The device pool provides
:class:`~sardana.pool.controller.PseudoMotorController` class that can be
overwritten to provide new calculations.

The pseudo motor position gets updated automatically every time one of its
motors position gets updated e.g. when the motion is in progress.

The pseudo motor object is also exposed as a Tango_ device.

Drift correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pseudomotors which have siblings and are based on physical motors with an
inaccurate or a finite precision positioning system could be affected by the
drift effect.

**Why does it happen?**

    Each move of a pseudomotor requires calculation of the physical motors
    positions in accordance with the current positions of its siblings.
    The consecutive movements of a pseudomotor can accumulate errors
    of the positioning system and cause drift of its siblings.

**Who is affected?**

    * **Inaccurate positioning systems** which lead to a discrepancy between 
      the write and the read position of the physical motors. In this case the
      physical motors must have a position sensor e.g. encoder but
      must not be configured in :term:`closed loop` (in some special cases,
      where the closed loop is not precise enough, the drift effect can be
      observed as well). This setup can lead to the situation where write and
      read values of the position attribute of the physical motors are
      different e.g. due to the loosing steps problems or the inaccurate
      *step_per_unit* calibration.

    * **Finite precision physical motors** e.g. :term:`stepper` is affected by
      the rounding error when moving to a position which does not translate
      into a discrete number of steps that must be commanded to the hardware.


**How is it solved in Sardana?**

    Sardana implements the drift correction which use is optional but enabled
    by default for all pseudomotors. It is based on the use of the write
    value, instead of the read value, of the siblings' positions, together with
    the new desired position of the pseudomotor being moved, during the
    calculation of the physical positions. The write value of the
    pseudomotor's position gets updated at each move of the pseudomotor or
    any of the underneath motors.

    .. note:: Movements being stopped unexpectedly: abort by the user,
        over-travel limit or any other exceptional condition may cause
        considerable discrepancy in the motor's write and read positions.
        In the subsequent pseudomotor's move, Sardana will also correct this
        difference by using the write instead of read values.

    The drift correction is configurable with the *DriftCorrection* property
    either globally (on the Pool device level) or locally (on each PseudoMotor
    device level).

**Example**

Let's use the slit pseudomotor controller to visualize the drift effect.
This controller comprises two pseudomotors: gap and offset, each of them based
on the same two physical motors: right and left. In this example we will
simulate the inaccurate positioning of the left motor (loosing of 0.002 unit
every 1 unit move).
