MacroServer
===========

Most probably your MacroServer will need to connect to one or more Device
Pools via the :ref:`sardana-macroserver-api-poolnames` attribute. This is
usually configured at the server creation time but can be also modified
later on. In case Sardana is used with Tango this configuration
is accessible via the ``PoolNames``
:class:`~sardana.tango.macroserver.MacroServer.MacroServer` device property.

You will certainly use the macro environment variables for changing macros
behavior at runtime. This environment is stored in a database configurable via
:ref:`sardana-macroserver-api-environmentdb` attribute. In case Sardana is
used with Tango this configuration is accessible via the ``EnvironmentDb``
:class:`~sardana.tango.macroserver.MacroServer.MacroServer` device property.

MacroServer is easily extendable by means of plugins of two types:
macros and recorders. MacroServer discovers them in directories
configurable via :ref:`sardana-macroserver-api-macropath` and
:ref:`sardana-macroserver-api-recorderpath` attributes. In case Sardana is
used with Tango this configuration is accessible via the ``MacroPath`` and
``RecorderPath`` :class:`~sardana.tango.macroserver.MacroServer.MacroServer`
device properties.

Your plugins may need to access to third party Python modules. One can
configure the directory where to look for them via
:ref:`sardana-macroserver-api-pythonpath` attribute. In case Sardana is
used with Tango this configuration is accessible via the ``PythonPath``
:class:`~sardana.tango.macroserver.MacroServer.MacroServer` device property.

Multiple macros can run concurrently in the MacroServer and the maximum number
of these threads is configurable via
:ref:`sardana-macroserver-api-maxparallelmacros` attribute. In case Sardana is
used with Tango this configuration is accessible via the ``MaxParallelMacros``
:class:`~sardana.tango.macroserver.MacroServer.MacroServer` device property
(default: 10).

Macros may report information to a file which is configurable via
:ref:`sardana-macroserver-api-logreportfilename` and
:ref:`sardana-macroserver-api-logreportformat`. In case Sardana is
used with Tango this configuration is accessible via the ``LogReportFilename``
and ``LogReportFormat``
:class:`~sardana.tango.macroserver.MacroServer.MacroServer` device properties.

MacroServer integrates natively with the
`Elastic Stack <http://www.elastic.co>`_ and may send logs to the a Logstash
instance. In case Sardana is used with Tango this configuration is
accessible via the ``LogstashHost`` and ``LogstashPort``
:class:`~sardana.tango.macroserver.MacroServer.MacroServer` device properties.
